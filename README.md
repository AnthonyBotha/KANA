# KANA
App Academy Team Project

Welcome to KANA, the platform where you can gamify your productivity by transforming tasks and goals into exciting adventures! In this app, you'll be able to create an account, track your daily habits, and customize your avatar with various rewards and achievements.

## Features:
### User Management
* Sign Up & Login: Create a new account to start managing your habits and tasks. If you're a returning user, log in to pick up where you left off.
* Profile Customization: Customize your avatar and personal settings to reflect your progress and achievements.
### Task Management
* Habit Tracking: Add habits you want to track regularly. Mark them as completed as you build positive habits or avoid negative ones.
* Daily Tasks: Set up daily to-dos and monitor your progress. Tasks reset every day to encourage consistency.
* To-Do Lists: Create longer-term tasks that donâ€™t have daily resets but help you stay organized and motivated.
### Avatars
* Customization: Choose from different styles, hair colors, outfits, and more to build a unique avatar that reflects your in-game achievements.
### Level Up
* Experience: As you complete your habits, daily tasks, and to-dos, you earn experience points that accumulate over time, allowing you to level up and showcase your progress and achievements.
* Health: You lose health points if you fail to complete or engage in negative habits. If your health bar reaches zero, you level down, reflecting a setback in your progress.
### Rewards
* Unlock: Earn rewards by completing tasks and leveling up. As you progress, more exciting rewards will be unlocked, keeping you motivated.
* Create: Customize your own rewards to celebrate your achievements. For example, treat yourself to "Watch my favorite TV show for 1 hour" or "Go for a relaxing walk" after completing your tasks. Personalize your rewards to suit your preferences!
### Inventory
* Buy: Completing tasks grants you gold, which you can use to purchase items for your inventory. The more tasks you complete, the more gold you'll accumulate!
* Create: Design and add unique items to your inventory that reflect your personality and interests. Whether it's a rare collectible or a personal milestone, your inventory becomes an extension of you.
